## FastAPI Base Scaffold

This repository contains a clean, async-first FastAPI project that wires together PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic, Redis, and JWT-ready security. It ships with Docker and docker-compose for local development.

### Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust secrets.
2. Install dependencies (recommended via Poetry): `poetry install`.
3. Run the stack: `docker compose up --build`.
4. Apply database migrations via Alembic when you add models.

### Project Layout

- `app/core`: Settings, cache, security helpers.
- `app/db.py`: Async engine/session factories.
- `app/api/v1`: Versioned API routers (no endpoints yet).
- `alembic/`: Migration environment scaffold.

Add your domain models under `app/models`, schemas under `app/schemas`, repositories under `app/repositories`, and service logic under `app/services`.
